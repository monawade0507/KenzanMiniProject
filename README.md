	Create a small web application that can do fizzbuz as a web service. This server should support one GET endpoint.

Techonolgy required for this:
	- open-source java servlet container: Apache Tomcat
	- Eclipes Java EE Developer IDE
	- java server pages
	- java version: 9.0.1

Instruction for running code
	I have included the entire java project in the repository.
	To run the program:
		1. Enter the edit window for FizzBuzzServlet.java
		2. Navigate to Run > Run As > Run on Server.
		3. Choose the avaiable server and click "Finish".
		There are 2 options for seeing the results for FizzBuzz:
		Option 1.)

			b.) To calculate the FizzBuzz, please change the '*' to the upperBound testing integer.

	IMPORTANT NOTE: The server must be running to connect with FizzBuzz and see the results on a web browser.
